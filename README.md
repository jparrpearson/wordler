# Wordler

Guess the randomly chosen word based on clues for each guess.

The length of the words to guess, and the source of the words, are both configurable.

The word lists are found under the [word-lists](./word-lists/) directory, and are generated using the [generate_lists.py](./generate_lists.py) script.

You can play the game directly from [here](https://jparrpearson.github.io/wordler/).
